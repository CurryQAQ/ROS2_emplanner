[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:66 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindosqpEigen.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "osqpEigen", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "osqpEigen" with
  any of the following names:

    osqpEigenConfig.cmake
    osqpeigen-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "osqpEigen" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "osqpEigen_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "osqpEigen" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
